Sprint 4 Tasks:
    Write comments. âœ…
    Test all functionality âœ…
    Switch grade with date of birth on form. âœ…
    Add option after form for student to save their respones for FERPA reasons (students need the ability to see the information they entered) âœ…
    Remove grade and trainer comments from database as they are not necessary. âœ…
    Encrypt school name, first name, last name, sport, date of birth, and contact phone number in addition to the password in the database to comply with HIPAA.
        This one is somewhat completed because school name and password are stored successfully encrypted and hashed respectively.
        The reason it's not fully completed is because we search on the athlete form information and the way we had originally planned to encrypt it (every form would have its own key and iv stored in the database), wouldn't work to search on values, so we're a little stuck on how to procede with encrypting that information which is necessary to comply with HIPAA. We'll look more into if there is a package to use for encryption/decryption that will secure the information and not leave it prone to attacks on the data.
    Update UserLogin file to connect to the database. âœ…
    Edit BusinessLogic and Database functionality to login with a hashed password and show error for invalid log in. âœ…
