    Description: The main tabbed page that serves as the central navigation hub for the application. 
                 This page allows users to switch between various tabs, such as Home, Profile, and Settings.
    Bugs: None reported.
    Reflection: Straightforward implementation since it primarily relies on the TabbedPage component.
