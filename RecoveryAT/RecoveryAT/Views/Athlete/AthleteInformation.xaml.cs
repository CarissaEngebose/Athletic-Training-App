    Description: AthleteInformation Screen with Flyout Menu
    Bugs: Search bar and bottom nav bar currently donâ€™t do anything.
    Reflection: I was able to use my AthletePastForms screen as the base and then add the flyout screen. 
                It was hard for me to implement, but my group was able to help.
